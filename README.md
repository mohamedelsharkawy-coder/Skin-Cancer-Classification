# Skin Cancer Classification 🩺🔬🌞

![Skin Cancer Classification Demo](media/skin_cancer_classification.gif)

## 🌟 Project Overview

Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide, and early detection can save lives ❤️.  
The **Skin Cancer Classification** project aims to automatically classify skin lesions into different categories using deep learning 🤖.  
This tool assists healthcare professionals and researchers by providing a second opinion and speeding up diagnosis.

## 🚀 Project Pipeline

The project follows a standard machine learning pipeline:

1. **📥 Data Gathering**  
   - Collected high-quality dermoscopic images from publicly available datasets.
2. **🧹 Data Preprocessing**  
   - Applied cleaning, resizing, augmentation, and normalization techniques.
3. **🛠️ Model Building and Training**  
   - Built and fine-tuned a deep learning model for classification (e.g., CNN, MobileNet, EfficientNet).
4. **🧪 Model Evaluation**  
   - Evaluated the model using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.
5. **🌐 Model Deployment**  
   - Deployed the model as a **Flask API** hosted on **Google Colab** using **ngrok** for public access.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack and Tools
- ⚡ TensorFlow / Keras
- 🐍 Python
- 🧩 Flask (for building the API)
- 🔗 Ngrok (for deployment tunneling)
- ☁️ Google Colab (for training and hosting)
- 🧮 OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas (for data handling)
